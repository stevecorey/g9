	Dear Dr. Brunvand,
	It appears that there is no standard way to cite websites. 
	Various online suggestions were to use AT-online, AT-misc, or AT-electronic.
	There were also other suggestions for producing the "Accesed on:" entry, some of which didn't work, others of which produced output in the wrong place. 
	Even the Wikipedia "cite this page" BibTex entry (supplied by Wikipedia itself) gave two instances of "online" in the "references" entry of the final output. 
	Finally, the IEEE style guide itself seemed to offer differing instructions depending on the type of webpage. 
	If you have specifics of how to properly do this, I'm all ears.
	
	Aside from these BibTeX issues, the issue with LaTeX seems to be that if it does something wonky, like putting tables in the middle of the references section, there's no easy way to fix it. At least, when I tried to fix it the fixes ended up causing other layout problems. You just have to accept that LaTeX gonna do what LaTeX gonna do. If you don't like it, then tough.
	
	Ultimately, here's what we went with...
